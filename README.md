# PhpXmlToJson
Use native php xml parsing modules to convert xml to json 

# Overview
The purpose is this coding assessment is to assess your general coding ability with PHP. You should use the task to demonstrate your ability with
core programming concepts, such as control-flow statements, conditional statements, array and object manipulation.
You will be expected to demonstrate your coding style, and good general code organisation skills. The requirement is purposefully lightweight -
anything that isn't self-evident, please make the most appropriate assumption.

# The Requirement
You should create a PHP script to take a given XML structure, and convert it to a JSON object. Sounds easy right? You need to do this manually -
using native PHP XML parsing modules, loops and array / collection parsing. So no json_encode/json_decode, or saving the XML to the
filesystem and using readFromFile type techniques!

# Bonus Points
Extra consideration will be given to your application for:
- Any XML validation
- Proper error handling
- Unit testing
- Any additional (relevant) functionality

# Instruction
- All the executable files are located in \app directory
- Phpunit is installed for this project, you can run the test with the command 'phpunit'
- 'priip.xsd' is the XML Schema file, to test out the XML validation you can run the xml file against the xsd file
